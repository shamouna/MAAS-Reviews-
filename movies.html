	       <h3>Official Film Synopsis</h3>
	           <p>
                Imprisoned on the other side of the universe, the mighty Thor finds himself in a deadly gladiatorial contest that pits him against the Hulk, his former ally and fellow Avenger.

	       <h3>Personal Review</h3>
	           <p>
	               “Willfully ‘imprisoned’ on the other side of the universe, the mighty Thor finds himself in a lackluster and quick gladiatorial skirmish that pits him against Hulk, his former ally and fellow Avenger. Thor’s quest for survival leads him in a race against what seems like never ending time to prevent the hyped up Hela from destroying his home world.</p>
	               
                   <p>This is what the synopsis should have read if it was to be somewhat accurate. I knew as soon as the first scene finished this movie was not going to be what I was expecting, and for the worse.</p>
                   
                    <p>For those who are not familiar with the comic books, this movie essentially crams a couple different serious, fan favorite storylines into a jumbled mess of a movie, Planet Hulk and Thor Ragnarok. The movie pays so little attention to the former that is isn’t even worth discussing. Hulk was stripped of one of arguably one of the best comic storylines written, and Ragnarok was given little attention as well. Instead, we were given a story that had way too many checkboxes it needed to cross off.</p>
                    
                    <p>This movie is advertised as a comedy, and a comedy it is, although to its detriment. Jokes around every nook and cranny. Sure I laughed at many of them, but there were also many jokes that did not land and/or got old fast. The jokes I did laugh at, were a guilty kind of laugh because the jokes at the end would end up hurting my perception of the film. Many serious topics were robbed of their emotional impact due to this, and it’s a shame. There were many inconsistencies throughout the film as well that I will not go into due to spoilers.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the end, a way to describe this film would be like someone made a fantastic looking burger with many toppings and cooked just right, and then the cook chewed it all up for you and spat it on your plate for you eat while calling it comedy. As a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far, I am sad to say that this film will disappoint many.</p>

	       <h2><span class="floatletter">D</span>unkirk</h2>
	       <h3>Official Film Synopsis</h3>    
	           <p>
	               In May 1940, Germany advanced into France, trapping Allied troops on the beaches of Dunkirk. Under air and ground cover from British and French forces, troops were slowly and methodically evacuated from the beach using every serviceable naval and civilian vessel that could be found. At the end of this heroic mission, 330,000 French, British, Belgian and Dutch soldiers were safely evacuated.
	           </p>
	           
	           <h3>Personal Review</h3>
	               <p>Christopher Nolan is one of the few directors who people know by name. Each of his films is highly anticipated, and for good reason. His recent films have all been critically acclaimed box office successes. For Dunkirk however, Nolan was looking for a change in his style of film making. Dunkirk will be Nolan’s attempt at directly winning an Oscar, something that more than a few out there say he finally deserves.</p>
	               
                    <p>The film is told with three different perspectives in mind; one week on the beach, one day on the water, and one hour in the air. Jumping back and forth through the different times can get confusing for some who initially do not know of this type of storytelling, but nonetheless it makes for a unique and engaging viewing experience as the sequences unfold.</p>
                    
                    <p>Dunkirk begins with a bang. Immediately the viewer is thrown into a battle on the outskirts of town with bullets flying everywhere. Interestingly though, none of the enemy was shown. This method of not directly showing the enemy is intentional, effective, and lasts throughout the entire film. Subtly in the background for the entire run of the movie, there is a sense of a ticking clock. Whether it was a literal clock ticking, or the score imitating a ticking clock, this aspect creates a sense of tension and high stakes that lasts from beginning to end.</p>
                    
                    <p>Dunkirk is an engaging, intense, gripping, and visually stunning film. If you’re a fan of World War II stories, highly tense sequences, or non-linear storytelling, this is a solid watch and even purchase.</p>

	       <h2><span class="floatletter">S</span>pider-Man: Homecoming</h2>
	       <h3>Official Film Synopsis</h3>
	           <p>Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, young Peter Parker returns home to live with his Aunt May. Under the watchful eye of mentor Tony Stark, Parker starts to embrace his newfound identity as Spider-Man. He also tries to return to his normal daily routine -- distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just a friendly neighborhood superhero. Peter must soon put his powers to the test when the evil Vulture emerges to threaten everything that he holds dear.</p>
	       
	       <h3>Personal Review</h3>
	           <p>Debuting in a small introductory role in Captain America: Civil War, Tom Holland’s Peter Parker/Spider-Man sure did have some heavy lifting to do to get movie-goers back into the theatre for a second reboot, and a third iteration of the character in a decade. Holland did have some help though, with Marvel Studios at the helm of the project, this version of the character fits right in to the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe of movies that fans have been invested in for 17 films now at the time of writing this. Spider-Man: Homecoming shows just how much muscle Marvel Studios still has to flex to get their beloved Spider-Man in the universe.</p>
	           
               <p>First and foremost, this movie is a coming of age story, and not just a generic superhero story. Sure Peter Parker has powers, and deals with superhuman and enhanced foes, but the real struggle and story lies with Peter Parker himself. Peter must deal with his newfound powers and the responsibility that it brings. Whether that would be dealing the petty criminals out on the streets, or deciding whether to use his powers for high school social issues, Peters struggle is real and relatable even when he’s Spider-Man. All of the characters are great. They are all relatable, and natural which is crucial to tell a believable story like this one.</p>
               
                <p>What is so great about this film is that it’s not an be-all-end-all plot with some huge grandiose world ending finale. This is a focused, small time character story that just happens to feature Spider-Man and Iron-Man. This is a must see.</p>
