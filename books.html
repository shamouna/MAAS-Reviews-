	           <h2><span class="floatletter">F</span>irst Frost by Sarah Addison Allen</h2>
	           <h3>Brief Synopsis:</h3>
	           <p><span class="italic">First Frost</span> is a magical tale, where we follow the path of the Waverly women. Starting out we follow Bay, the fifteen year old daughter of Sydney Waverly, as she traverses high school with abilities that set her apart from the norm making her somewhat of an outcast among her peers. Bay has her heart set on love this Fall season, and is quite heartsick over her situation. Claire Waverly, and Bay's Aunt (Sydney's sister), is just getting started on her ever-growing candy business and Sydney Waverly on the other hand, has her heart set on having another child with a desire that threatens to overwhelm her. Amidst all of this, a stranger appears in the town that causes the Waverly sister's to make an unexpected decision.</p><br>
	           <h3>Review:</h3>
	           <p>Enchanting, is the word that comes to mind when we think of the world Sarah Addison Allen has created in <span class="italic">First Frost</span>. The magic and joy that the women bring to the story and to each other is a joy to follow along with. The mystery and intrigue of the strange man who arrives in town clearly intent on doing damage to the Waverly woman brings tension to the novel and Bay, the typical teenager with a mad crush, that goes far beyond just a crush keeps us well occupied while we try to work out what is going on with the stranger. The two Waverly sister's Claire and Sydney, have troubles of their own - which I thought really kept the story interesting in the end. Never a dull moment, always something happening in the Waverly's lives we keep entranced in the mystery of the novel, and with hope that everything will turn out exactly as it should for this family.</p>

	       <h2><span class="floatletter">T</span>he Book Thief by Markus Zusak</h2>
	       <h3>Brief Synopsis:</h3>
	       <p>Liesel, a foster child living with her foster parents in Germany during World War II has a penchant for books. So much so, that she begins stealing them whenever she finds them available. Learning to read with the help of her foster father, and sharing the stories she has stolen with a Jewish man hiding in their basement, Liesel reminds us of the power of words.</p>
	       <h3>Review:</h3>
	       <p>This book was fantastic, and is one of my favorites. Liesel and her stolen escapades bring us on many a journey, but none so great as the journey she takes with the Jewish man in their basement through reading. It is a powerful story, with an equally powerful ending. I honestly do not want to say too much as it might give away the story, and I highly recommend this to everyone who is a reader.

	       <h2><span class="floatletter">T</span>he Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield</h2>
	       <h3>Brief Synopsis:</h3>
	       <p>Margaret is hired to write a biography for reclusive author Vida Winters. What follows is a tale so outrageous and confusing that Margaret begins to wonder what is the truth of the story.</p>
	       <h3>Review:</h3>
	       <p>This book was so confusing and terrible in the beginning that at first I hated it with great passion, but as the story progressed I just couldn't put it down. It was so intriguing, filled with horrible tales and stories of a history we wouldn't wish on anybody, so disgusting at points that we want to throw the book across the room and yet, we find we must finish it. As Margaret is left wondering the truth so are we the reader, and it takes many twists and turns before we finally reach the ending of the tale, where such a huge turn is taken that finally the story makes sense. So much so that in the end it turns out that I loved this book.</p><br>
	       <p>If you are looking for an unpredictable read, without the usually happy ending, then this story is for you. Unusual and unique, I've never read anything like it. A mystery of a tale that we are taken on, that drives you crazy and pulls you in, only to lead you into a grand finale of truth unlike anything you've ever expected!</p>
