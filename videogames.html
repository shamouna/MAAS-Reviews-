	       <h2><span class="floatletter">K</span>erbal Space Program (KSP)</h2> 
	       <a href="https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/en/">KSP Website</a> 
	       <p>KSP is a space simulation game. It's a game about buiding rockets, space planes, space stations, planatary stations, and so much more. It has an in-built physics engine, which is not perfect, but does a very good job keeping the game realistic. KSP does have a pretty steep learning curve, if one wants to play the game along its intended path. However, anyone can enjoy the game. It is very easy to slap some parts together and power a rocket into space, or even better, watch it explode in a fiery rain of parts.</p>
	       
	       <h3>Modes</h3>
	       <p>Career mode has the highest difficulty out all three of the modes. It also considered by most in the community to be the "default" mode. This mode incorporates a sciency level, which dictates which parts are unlocked. Also, it contains a very simple "economy" which revolves around contracts, money, and reputation level.</p>
	       <p>Science mode is the next available mode. It is one consdered one level of diffculty lower than career mode, and does not include the economy model, instead it only includes science levels, which can be increased by traveling to different areas and conducting experiments.</p>
	       <p>The last mode the game offers is Sandbox mode. This is the easiest mode out of all three. All the parts are unlocked, there is no reputation to worry about, and money is unlimited. this mode is easiest for new players to understand the game and how it works.</p>
	       <p>On top of these game modes, there are quite a few other options that can either increase or decrease difficulty. These options exist regardless of mode and can be changed at any time. So, a new player might want to play in a career mode save can lower the difficulty, but then raise it later on after s/he has gotten used to the game.</p>
	       
	       <h3>Gameplay</h3>
	       <p>You can build just about anything space related in this game, and that is just in the stock game. There are mods out there that allow a player to expand that even further. You want to build SpaceX's new Falcon 9 rocket? You can do it, completely stock. You can even land the first stage, just like SpaceX does in real life. Or, maybe you're a sci-fi fan and love star wars or star trek. You can build it. It may not fly exactly as you picture it, but that is only because the physics engine is not built to handle sci-fi crafts, but it can be built and it may fly. </p>
	       <p>The game simulates a scaled down 9 planet solar system that majorly correlates with our own(including Pluto). There are few diference, like the amount of moons around a planet. The game does have a high learning curve. Understandably, it is hard to get a rocket to space and then operations from then on are just as difficult. However, on the other hand, you slap enough boosters on a rocket...it'll get to space. How useful it will be in continuing exploration, thats a bit iffy. </p>
	       <p>This game is strictly PC, at one time they did port it to console, but the game became quite unweildy, and lost some of its core in-flight features. So, it did not sell well and was pulled off the cosole stores very soon after the port was created. Since the game is PC only, the games performance varies greatly depending on the PC in question. However, it seems the limit is right around 500-700 parts before the player begins to expierence lag. However, there are mods that can help mitigate this lag. Another issue that can be fatal, but is normally rare are the inexplicable explosions that may occur. Because of how the physics engine loads in, there is a small chance that the game may bug and explode your craft. It is a very rare occurance and the developers normally patch any issue in later versions.</p>
	       
	       <h3>Mods</h3>
	       <p>The modding community is vast for this game. There are mods ranging from cosmetic changes to adding realism(aka difficulty) to the game. There is also a site, <a href="kerbalx.com">KerbalX.com</a>, dedicated to uploading crafts that people have built.</p>
	       
	       
	       
	       <h3>Pros</h3>
	       <ul>
	           <li>Mods</li>
	           <li>Building and Flying Rockets</li>
	           <li>Realistic Physics Engine</li>
	           <li>Adjustable Difficuty</li>
	       </ul>
	       <h3>Cons</h3>
	       <ul>
	           <li>Inexplicable Bugs/Explosions</li>
	           <li>Steep Learning Curve</li>
	           <li>Lag for large crafts</li>
	       </ul>
            
            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>Kerbal Space Program is a fun game. It has its issue at times, but overall it is a blast to play. Even slapping together a rocket that you know is going to explode within seconds is still fun to do. The game cost around $40, and I think it is worth every penny. For those that don't wish to simply splurge out $40, there is a free demo version that is available. <span class="desktop">Click on the buy it now link in the left sidebar for more informaion.</span></p>

	       <h2><span class="floatletter">R</span>ocket League</h2>
	       <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/">Rocket League Website</a>
	       <p>Rocket League is soccer, no, its hockey, no no no....its basketball. Actually the sports isn't as important. It's sports played in cars. Yeah, you read that right...in cars. Super sturdy, jumping, boosting cars. There are a variety of game modes. There is classic, soccer. Then there is hockey, basketball and even a sort of "the floor is lava" type of game mode. Really, its more about what mode can the developers think of next. As an added bonus, the game is only $20.</p>
	       
	       <h3>Gameplay</h3>
	       <p>The game has various modes with different styles of play, but the objectives are very similar so I will not go into too much detail on that. Matchups can be either anywhere between 1v1 to 3v3. 3v3 is the most popular for online match play. Unlikes the last review, KSP, this does have online match play. Not only does this allow to play anyone online, but it is one of the few games that does have cross platform interaction. Well, except for Playstation...you'll have to ask Sony for that reason on that. As the term cross platform suggests, the game can be played with either mouse and keyboard or with a controller. Honestly, playing the game on on keyboard and mouse, however, is a nightmare. It can be enjoyable after you get used it, but until you do...its just not great. Plus, if you have more than one controller, it does support offline multi-player.</p>
	       <p>As for the game itself, the objectives are pretty simple. Score and don't get scored on. To help your team you can collect perodic boosts and use them either to well, boost, or to destroy the opposing teams cars. It is still a ton of fun to play. </p>
	       <h3>Online</h3>
	       <p>Admittedly, I do not have much expiernce playing online, however, it is a major part of the appeal of this game. In fact, it is popular enough to spawn multiple leagues with prize pools worth up to 150 thousand dollars.</p> 
	       <p>According to the publishing company, <a href="http://psyonix.com">Psyonix</a>, there are roughly 1.1 million unique players online daily. This number will only grow in the future, on Nov. 14 of 2017, the game is coming to the Nintendo Switch, and I can only imagine how popular it will be.</p>
	       
	       <h3>Pros</h3>
	           <ul>
	               <li>Sports With Cars</li>
	               <li>Simple to pick up</li>
	               <li>Online Cross-Platform Play</li>
	           </ul>
	           
	       <h3>Cons</h3>
	           <ul>
	               <li>Tough to play with Keyboard and Mouse</li>
	               <li>Can get repetitive</li>
	           </ul>
	           
	       <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
	       <p>It is a fun game. It can get repetitive since overall the goals of each mode are very similar. But I think it is definitely worth the 20 dollar price tag. It is also a game that does go on sale. As such, if you have the requisite cash, I so go for the purchase, if you are playing with a controller.<span class="desktop">Click on the buy it now link in the left sidebar for more informaion.</span> </p>

	       <h2><span class="floatletter">T</span>he Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h2>
	       <a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/skyrim?">Skyrim Website</a>
	       <p>Skyrim is the most popular game that I am reviewing on this page. It has won countless awards since being released in November of 2011. It's a midieval RPG with magic that has huge open world with a ton of playble content. There are also 3 singleplayer DLC's that have been released that have added a pretty decent chunk to the game aswell. I have owned the game since its release and I have probably put easily over 500 hours into the game in the last 6 years. Recently, the publishing company, <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/dashboard">Bethesda</a>, came out with an HD remaster for the newer consoles and PC.</p>
	       <h3>Gameplay</h3>
	       <p>There is so much to do in the game. I know for a fact that even though I have played the game the a lot, I have to not come close to completeing every objective. However, there are two "main-er" questlines in the game. However, you can play the game for hundreds of hours and never even touch those quests. The main story follows the dragonborn who is on a quest to bring peace to the land of Tamriel both from a civil war and from the invading dragons. There is a lot of other side quests aswell for quelling different factions and dietys. It is a big place. There is no online gameplay...and honestly it is not needed. Bethesda recently released <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/agegate">Elder Scrolls Online</a> which is sort of like an online skyrim, but it is considered a seperate game.</p>
	       <h3>Mods</h3>
	       <p>Recently, mods became available to players that own the game on XBOX One, however, the mods have been around for quite a while for anyone who played on PC. You can already do a lot things in the game, but mods can increase that by 10-fold. There are mods that can make cosmetic changes ranging to completely overhauling the game.For Skyrim PC mods, there is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/72850/workshop/">Steam Workshop</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/?">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>
	       
	       <h3>Pros</h3>
	           <ul>
	               <li>Gigantic Open World</li>
	               <li>Lots of Playble Content</li>
	               <li>Swords and Magic</li>
	               <li>Mods(XBOX One and PC)</li>
	           </ul>
	           
	       <h3>Cons</h3>
	           <ul>
	               <li>...</li>
	           </ul>
	           
	       <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
	       <p>Go buy Skyrim...seriously, if you have the money and don't already own it. Go buy it asap. Unless, you have exams or important deadline coming up. Then don't buy it, wait till later, because once you do, it will take up a decent bit of your time.<span class="desktop">Click on the buy it now link in the left sidebar for more informaion.</span> </p>
