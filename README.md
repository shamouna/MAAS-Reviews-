# MAAS-Reviews-
CIS 268 Semester HTML Project

This was my groups project for our Internet Media and Programming class.
Our group decided to create a site in which we review different things.
Each one of us picked a category in which we wanted to explore and review and we did so.
We used collaborative tools to help combine code and format everything with CSS.
We then pulled all our code together and compiled it on a local machine before publishing it to our server.
